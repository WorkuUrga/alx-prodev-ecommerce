# Dynamic E-Commerce Product Catalog

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world scenario of creating a dynamic e-commerce product catalog, where users can browse, filter, and sort products seamlessly. It emphasizes key industry practices such as API integration, responsive design, and advanced UI/UX enhancements. The goal is to build a scalable, maintainable frontend while optimizing performance for high-traffic scenarios through pagination and infinite scrolling.

By completing this project, participants will gain hands-on experience with:
- Building scalable, maintainable frontends using modern technologies.
- Optimizing performance for high-traffic scenarios through pagination and infinite scrolling.
- Ensuring accessibility and responsiveness for diverse user bases.

## Project Goals
The primary objectives of the e-commerce product catalog are:
1. **API Integration**: Fetch and display product data dynamically from a backend API.
2. **User Convenience**: Implement filtering and sorting to improve product discovery.
3. **Enhanced Experience**: Develop a responsive, user-friendly interface with seamless navigation and optimized performance.

## Technologies Used
- **React/React Native**: For building the component-based user interface.
- **Redux**: To manage application state efficiently.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For designing a modern, responsive UI.

## Key Features
1. **API Data Integration**
   - Fetch and display product data dynamically from a backend API.
   - Ensure smooth loading of products with error handling and loading states.
   
2. **Filtering and Sorting**
   - **Category Filtering**: Allow users to view products based on selected categories.
   - **Price Sorting**: Enable sorting by ascending or descending prices.
   - **Multi-Criteria Filters**: Combine filters for refined results.

3. **Pagination and Infinite Scrolling**
   - **Pagination**: Provide numbered navigation for viewing products in chunks.
   - **Infinite Scrolling**: Load products dynamically as users scroll, enhancing usability.

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure the catalog is fully responsive across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
